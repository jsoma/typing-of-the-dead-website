5 minutes into the game
A path anyone must follow
A thousand origami cranes
As it appears to outsiders
Bogie at twelve o'clock
Caught with my pants down
Chance to get acquainted
Coffee, tea, or me?
Devote life to beef bowls
Don't squeeze pimples
Dostoyevsky depresses me
Drapes are people, too
Eradicate the termites!
Everyone has temptations
Extremely sensitive area
Fee fie fo fum!
Garage sales man's pitch
Get a job through contacts
Got run over by reindeer
I taught my dog how to read
I wouldn't go back there
It depends on the zombie
It weighs 3000 tons
It's like beating the air
Like husband, like wife
Mail order companion
Night watchman on the nod
Obscure designer clothes
Picasso esque desserts
Pick your nose and eat it
Pin heeled pensioner
Plastic surgery detector
See you later, alligator
The voice has been dubbed
Three balls and no strikes
Thus, with a kiss, I die
Typical ADD poster child
Villagers never say much
Wake him out of his trance
Wallowing in melancholy
Welcome to the real world
We're business partners
Why is there suffering?
Willing to be your dummy
Work 100 hours a week
Yoga, yoga, warden!
You are always on my mind
Your dinner is in the dog
Your tears can't fool me
You're too weak kneed
200 mph guitar thrash
A bucketful of champagne
Action paint on wheels
Awaiting your devastation
Believe in Rock and Roll
Boring, flabby and gray
Carry baby in a paper bag
Did you wash your hands?
Do chickens have lips?
Doesn't anybody care?
Enough to make a cat speak
From blasphemy to murder
George Bush impersonator
Good at shamming sickness
He sponges on his parents
Hello birds, hello trees
If I had a million dollars
If only you knew the truth
If the company is paying
In a way I'm dead already
Last dance of the evening
Let's do the boogie again
Marshmallow grizzly bear
Mouthing "hi, mom"
No perfume on guard duty
Nuclear power engine
Opprobrious invectives
Outplay the leading actor
Outstanding excuse maker
Rose tinted spectacles
Serious shortage of brides
Several months of therapy
Super happy special fun
The Fair Trade Commission
They stuffed me in a trunk
Valid until your birthday
What are you looking at?
Where did everyone go?
Why not? She's willing
Witch on a hockey stick
You do it that often!?
Your father loves you best
A series of misfortunes
Antiphony of obscenities
Arrested under suspicion
Artificially intelligent
Beware the brides of March
Bits, bytes butts and bats
Blinded by love of money
Boar, dear and butterfly
Break your mother's heart
But the rescue never came
Call us or write us now!
Cuban food for beginners
Don't try to be my mother
Drop out of the top group
Dwarfs, elves, pixies
Emergency vehicles only
Excruciating politeness
Foot in mouth disease
Fun world of sudsy hairdos
Gush milk out of your nose
Gyroscopic proportions
Happily under probation
He comes to play everyday
He really is a good person
Here's a look in your eye
Hidden camera is running
Hieroglyphic love letter
How to raise a gifted child
I really admire your shoes
In one ear, out the other
Learning curve too steep
Living image of a Martian
Mascarpone sweet baloney
May his soul rest in peace
Merely nominal crab meat
Military unintelligence
Mobile phone revolution
Need an elastic string?
Papa, don't gimme that
Pickles are dill cious
Procession of flashy cars
Push the button on its head
School uniforms sold here
Scrubbing and scratching
Secret daughter of Monroe
Serve chops to karate guys
Sine, cosine, tangent
Some people never learn
The work kept me hopping
Who's that guy with you?
Withdraw before removing
Wrestling hold of the week
You're breaking my heart
You're imagining things
Yuri Alexeyevich Gagarin
A pair of swimming trunks
A rat is a rat is a rat is a rat
All in all is all we all are
Asian inflected French
Automatic sushi roll maker
Canada is a big, big state
Chronic fatigue syndrome
Collect them, trade them
Core competency hearing
Counterfeit calling card
Damning with faint praise
Do you come here often?
Don't look at me like that
Dried up and undesired
Early bird catches the fish
F1, press F1 for help
Flubba, flubba, flubba
Football sized burritos
Green plastic garbagebags
Hit by half eaten hotdogs
Ich bin ein cyberpunken
Icon of an innocent girl
I'll be your honey bee
Incipient belly bulge
It's only rock'n'roll
Join your hands in prayer
Lightly seasoned dish boom
Not in front of the parrot
Out of sight, out of mind
Pencil lead is poisonous
Savardian Spinorama move
Seeking "Tama" the cat
Should I stay or should I go
Spare me change, please
The death threat you sent me
There's a ghost behind you
Trams that pass in the night
Treasury of terrible jokes
What do men really want?
Which plane are you on?
Without a care in the world
You didn't try to call me
You will like my hometown
You wore out your welcome
350 light years ago
4 days with nothing to eat
635 days a year?
An elephant never forgets
Artificial incompetence
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
At the lowest point of life
Bus burst by gas explosion
Convincing explanation
Day to day management
Deep in Indian mountains
Desperate defensive fight
Don't get mad, get even
Egg boiled in a hot spring
Every mother's nightmare
Fabulous dolphinlike fish
First come, first served
Five seconds before a kiss
Full of juice and vinegar
Hard core intellectuals
I did well, didn't I?
I scared him out of his wits
I thought I ripped you off
Just another panic Monday
Keep yourself warm in bed
Living in a cardboard box
Long line for the bathroom
My hat is hot, hot is my hat
No flexibility whatsoever
Not the face, hit the body
Phonically obscene words
Raising its ugly head again
Remove your wedding ring
Say it with plastic flowers
Schemer drowns in schemes
Sex, lies and scotchtape
She poses as my girlfriend
Stop the blah blah blah
Strengthen the weak points
The biggest in the industry
The last summer of my teens
We won't be undersold!
What's to become of me?
WWW world wide watermelon
You've got the wrong idea
Abdominal pain, no gain
All's well that ends well
Appropriate table manner
Bittersweet summer memory
Captain of the soccer team
Climb the statue of liberty
Could be beautiful or ugly
Crashing in around my ears
Dark clouds on the horizon
Deep books with long words
Dissatisfaction Guaranteed
Does your old lady know?
Driving at a snail's pace
Eat everything on the menu
E business professional
Every home should have one
Give everybody the finger
Habitual class skipping
Hate tomatoes with a passion
He's going to explode!
I don't care a fig for you
I love my wife but...
I'll do a good job for you
I'm only pinching faces
Ironing your under things
Is that really necessary?
It could happen to anyone
It is a tale told by an idiot
It's not gonna work on me
Jolly good show, chap!
Keep trying until you win
Let's stick gum to his hair
Let's take a run in a wheel
Lipstick loving lawyer
Mausoleum of Halicarnassus
Nervous in the shower room
Nice greasy pork sandwich
Nice kilt you're wearing
Playing chess face to face
Pretty vacant parking lot
Private production parts
Red spots all over the body
Sales ability not required
She made a family man of me
Sit back and enjoy the ride
Small basket in a big basket
Take the exam as a substitute
Trick or treating is a trip
The blame is entirely mine
The same underwear for days
Tweedledum and Tweedledee
Unrehearsed performances
Villagers are staring at me
Was it bad for you, too?
Watch the game on TV at home
What are you waiting for?
Whip'em with a bike chain
Whispering into the phone
Who's the birthday girl?
Worst situation imaginable
Would you do that for me?
Your secret desires are bad
You're ignoring me
Appropriate relationship
Arms races, armless wastes
Buffeted about in the world
Can you scratch my back?
Cholera formula screaming
Complicated relationship
Dance in the disco go go go
Discuss amongst yourselves
Don't believe a word I say
Don't let me see you again
Don't take it out on me!
Dress to succeed class
Falling over like dominos
Foul mouthed hypocrites
Fragile, handle with care
Going around setting fires
He said turn to page what?
I don't want to be an adult
I'm a kid, that's my job
I'm gonna sue your lawyer
It's raining cats and dogs
Just like riding a bicycle
Look, here he comes again
Makeup makes a difference
Multimedia, neo comedia
Net chatting all the time
Not politically minded
Pick your own $2 lb
Pick me up e mails
Protest rallies snowballed
Some who go sip also gossip
Stir well before applying
That's not to be mentioned
The never fail sick excuse
The price on the tag is MRP
Tokyo, the sleepless city
Transcendental meditation
We had a series of bad breaks
We must be over the rainbow
Wearing culottes is a trick
We'd like to hear from you
We're very short handed
A goat in sheep's clothing
A great student loved by all
A heart can take just so much
Burgers for dinner tonight
Can't get no disinfectant
Chirp of cicadas in chorus
Exclusive charcoaled beef
Eyes are windows of the soul
Get in touch with your roots
He looks just like his father
I am him, he is me...
Ignore feelings altogether
Intervertebral disk hernia
Kids know nothing about war
Let's find our own planet
Life is a pretty sweet fruit
Make an experiment on you
Minimal, obliging smile
My name is "e"s mail
My tarantula's escaped!
On tour around Saskatchewan
Pump parading pervert
Raise the standard of revolt
Real men don't eat quiche
Scrap yard at a junk tion
She had a nerve to come here
Stamp glue tastes delicious
Stop chewing your toenails
The worst scandal in history
Traits of the youngest child
Understanding your hamster
Under the table tickle
We risked our lives for him
Wear some makeup, please
We're on the shark's menu
What are you looking for?
You can't get away from me
You know that I care for you
You'll have to pay for that
8 lessons life teaches you
After all we're only human
Anti fragrance policies
At children's eye level
Children can be the glue
Condemned child criminal
Countdown to a new century
Full of fun and rare videos
Hang it, stand it or tilt it
He always boasts about his son
Heel today, gone tomorrow
He's shy during the daytime
Hickory, dickory, dock
I don't need your comfort
I'll remember some of you
Illegal wood burning stove
I'm not going back to jail
I'm on your side, Mister
Is this a Halloween party?
Keep coming back for more
Lack of self confidence
Long way to the major league
Make a great to do about it
Nothing can make her afraid
Obnoxious bumper stickers
Oh my! Look at the time!
Please, please don't!
Prices and income policy
Professional yo yo ist
Rich, bored and beautiful
Sleep until 16:00
Something's behind you!
Unbelievably short people
Well matched sumo wrestlers
Woom in on my empty wallet
You came a day after the fair
Your life needs good rhythm
You're a very clever girl
10 billion light years
Accessories sold separately
An army travels on its belly
Coming to a theatre near you
Could have been dead by now
Do I smell like gasoline?
Doggy bags shaped like swans
Doing well after childbirth
Evenings in front of the TV
Extenuating circumstances
Feign your dad's signature
Give you 8 dollars for her
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAL!
Gotta look on the bright side
I don't wanna be an outcast
If you want it, it's yours
I'm turning into a zombie
Invincible domino player
Just checking for pinholes
Lame excuse, blame in use
Looking for Mr. Right Now
May I see your silly walk?
Mighty fine, if you ask me
Neglect friends and family
One giant leap for mankind
Pierce a private body part
Pocket money account book
Possessed by an evil spirit
Pyramid investment scheme
The disco boom has died down
There's no time for joking
Too hard for a dummy like me
Traumatized by politicians
Ugly dog just like its owner
Unimposing looking man
We're in for a real wet one
You look like a grasshopper

For the sake of neighborliness
From the gentleman over there
Haven't I seen you before?

Shall I put it in my pants?
The joke turned out to be true
The queen of TV commercials
Well being of middleclass
What was I just going to say?
Work 'til ya knuckles bleed
You could've got killed!
You have the right to be wrong
You shouldn't lie in the sun
You'll laugh, you'll cry
All you can eat buffet
Are you sure you're awake?
Beat the heat and eat to the beat
Burritos the size of your head
Captain, thar be whales here
Close the door when you leave
Don't call my mother that!
Easy to beat up, hard to kill
Five thousand screaming fans
Give the parrot his medicine
Goat entrails and rabbits feet
How come I sweat when I eat?
If you drive, don't drink
It's about time for a new car
I've had bottles thrown at me
Keep pressing the fire alarm
Kill the invisible swordsman
Let's repeat the scene again
Long hair and bushy sideburns
Lunch box at the shooting site
Mares eat oats and does eat oats
Merry go round sushi bar
Off court tennis coaching
On her way to enter a nunnery
Only interested in one thing
Overuse of the verbal weapon
Rapidly getting old and ugly
Rock'n'roll is here to stay
Smarter than the average llama
They look like miniature ants
This story is full of suspense
Turn back while you still can
Visitors from the outer world
We have to say good bye here
What the hell are you doing?
Why am I playing this game?
You've got to face the music
A room with a tense atmosphere
All fed up and no place to go
Are my suspenders straight?
Ball hit me square in the face
Be a bad girl during vacation
Chain gang musical comedy
Decorate your father's belly
Did my heart love till now?
Direct hit on the vital organs
Doctor who enjoys operations
Embarrassing and humiliating
Filthiest person in the world
Forget the cold bohemian hell
Frolicking through the forest
He rolled his eyes and fainted
Hold me, thrill me, hug me
I don't have an English name
I think of the strangest things
I won't let you have your way
Ice cream float in a diet soda
I'll deal with the pain later
It ended while I was sleeping
It's only a figure of speech
No smoking in this courtroom
Numbing of certain feelings
Pick your nose and stare at it
Put your hand in your pocket
Stamp collecting is my hobby
Stimulate a maternal instinct
Tears run down onto the letter
The first time to see real snow
The Tigris Euphrates Valley
Uncomfortable relationships
We should know better than that
Wheered you git that turkey?
Why can't you use a toilet?
Woman who'll change my life
A hiccup is a diaphragm spasm
A pair of star cross'd lovers
As long as we don't get caught
At the end of the hard delivery
Attention, little old ladies
Bandanna originated in India
Cycling originated in Japan
Don't interrupt me, honey
Eat and sleep, eat and sleep
Even monkeys dwell on things
Fuscia pants with sleeveless T
Get on your knees and confess
How to relieve stiff shoulders
I'll do it if it will save her
Is it the meat or the motion?
It's only between you and me
It's painful, isn't it?
Know the breed, know the dog
Leave the young couple alone
Live from the Kitchen Stadium
Must have been something I ate
Prince in sheep's clothing
Public heated swimming pool
The finder was the murderer
The punishment fits the crime
There's a ghost following you
This is my other brother Darryl
Twitching vein in the temple
Undeniable animal attraction
You dirty rotten swine you!
You're damn right I'm right
A gang of rotten little clowns
A mouthful of frozen gasoline
Crisp outside, moist inside
Don't care about how you look
Don't forget to wear your wig
Don't let the car outta the bag
Fanning the flames of passion
For the sake of neighborliness
From the gentleman over there
Haven't I seen you before?
He wanted to know every detail
Heard it through the grapevine
Honeycomb sandwich structure
Lead an extremely frugal life
Let me introduce myself first
Listen to what your granny says
Long, protruding nasal hair
My fate hung by a single thread
Non compos mentis defendant
Place chefs go after midnight
Rumbling and rolling stomach
Sick of school, sick of life
Strong, in control woman
Sudden change of air pressure
Superbly acute sense of smell
The earth was round, after all
The Montagues and the Capulets
Turned down like an old duvet
Vampire gunman runs amok!
Wander around the bar district
What is the meaning of void?
What's the cloud look like?
Your compassion can kill you
Become somebody in the future
Come see my stamp collection
Convenience store lunch box
Even a cactus dies in her room
First love with an older woman
Gained weight after childbirth
Gold caskets carved with runes
Hold chopsticks like pencils
I will never forget till I die
I'm going back to my parents
Inside the peanut man costume
It hurts me too much to hurt you
Large sized discarded items
Look both ways before crossing
Mayonnaise moisturizing mask
Mental pressure destroyed him
My door is always open for you
Oranges are a peeling fruit
Palace and Park of Versailles
Parade around the locker room
Proper hairdo for school boys
Run around with your fly open
Snatch the feather from my foot
Somebody put a curse on me?
Steal a neighbor's newspaper
Take care of your legs, girls
The sun shines out of my behind
'ullo, 'ullo, 'ullo!

Don't use no double negatives
Don't you have any friends?

The human body is about 2 3 water
Ugliness and beauty of everyday life
Where there's smoke, there's fire
You can play for up to 2 hours a day
10 lb. of ground pork, please
Adam and Eve on a raft and wreck 'em
Clicking sound of a Japanese camera
Do you really love those old jeans?
Does your mother know you're out?
Got 2 chocolate bars for my birthday
It shouldn't have ended up like this
Like a dead body without any response
She doesn't wanna lead a normal life
Speak several languages and use none
Touch your nose with your eyes closed
Wear jeans to keep dirty old men away
We're looking for our neighborhood
What made you come all the way here?
World made of chocolates and candies
Would you like to be my son in law?
You have the right to remain confused
You left the dogs in the South Pole?
Acquaintance of my cousin's uncle
And hast thou slain the Jabberwocky?
Appearance doesn't go with the name
Are you feeling what I'm feeling?
Children should be heard and not seen
Come from behind grand slammer
Cut the onion fine so you can't tell
Extensive collection of hair nets
I always tell the truth even when I lie
I've convinced my parents already
Leftover spaghetti is pasta its prime
Librarian from Marshfield Wisconsin
Oh! If only I had double eyelids!
Ooze chemistry and drive women wild
Overwhelmingly quick performance
Remember how many times I fed you?
Rub this on your skin to make it brown
The acceptable face of the human race
Things women aren't supposed to see
Toilet dressed in a fuzzy puce snood
Turn around and see who's behind you
We used to drink out of the same bottle
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep
A broken heart is sometimes incurable
Approved by the Ministry of Finance
Be he the humblest doorman in the firm
Because he was too faithful to the rules
Bra hooks are puzzle rings of love
Don't go away, we'll be right back
Don't you think that it's unusual?
For me to know and for you to find out
From hunt and peck to touchtype
Harmony is everything to the Japanese
He led a lonely life until he got a dog
I'm the world's greatest everything
I've been a pain in the ass, I know
Listen class, this will be on the test
Must be postmarked no later than today
My existence is a pure waste of space
New England clam chowder in the face
Nothing like a good piece of hickory
Pay per view only $49.99
Sharp questions by little journalists
The last Sunday in the summer vacation
The pitcher walked him intentionally
They started throwing cold water on me
This is the time I can reveal my talent
Uniform covered with advertisements
19 more dogs until spring...
Almost full, excluding vacant seats
Appreciate people with big eyebrows
Call our agency in your neighborhood
Did I do anything stupid last night?
Do you really think caviar's tasty?
I couldn't believe she knew my name
I got no rhythm but I know how to count
If I wasn't a man then I'd be a woman
It is consoling that nobody was killed
It's not over till the thin lady sings
Mother induced alternative lifestyle
The size of her shoes is the only reason
Eats meats West Korean BBQ in Ames Iowa
Global Warming Mugs and Ts Now on sale
Go ahead and beat yourself up mentally
I know that you know that I know what?
I like you, I love you, I adore you
I now pronounce you husband and wife
Impossibly good natured landowner
Money, money, money, money!
The check bounced for the second time
Umbrellas and other things left behind
Walk in a straight line heel to toe
Why do I look much better in photos?
You couldn't swing a dead cat in here
You must unlearn what you have learned
Your fingerprints were on the window
Cooked seaweed mixed with a sea spider
Damn fine cup of coffee and hot!
Hip py, hip py, shake shake
I was just being quiet with my eyes shut
It will be omitted from consideration
Once upon a time, like, last month
Play poker with 3 imaginary players
That cheesecake looks too good to resist
You'll see, I'm gonna be a big star
Your words are barely out of your mouth
Four score and seven years ago...
3 years since the harrowing incident
65% of Finns use mobile phones
An eye for an eye makes the world blind
Confess love through in house phone
Conversation between a cow and a horse
Drive west until my car stops running
Here's your change, $5000
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way
My brass studded collars collection
Sounds like a country and western song
Stand on one foot with your eyes closed
Thin person screaming to get out of me
Think about a good excuse to play hooky
You spin me around round round round
Your overconfidence is your weakness
You're turning into a typing zombie
5,972 sextillion metric tons
An old eagle is better than a young crow
Between him and a pig, bet on the pig
Fifth trip within 2 hours to the toilet
If you lick my shoes, I'll marry you
I'm only doing this for your own good
Lecherously laughing Libyan librarian
My left arm is longer than the right one
My only love sprung from my only hate
Nobody insulted me like that before!
Responsibility for a chain of failures
That's strange, I shaved this morning
This music sounds like a military march
You are the only person I can count on
